# DevOps Foundations

My notes from the LinkedIn Learning course *DevOps Foundations*, by James Wickett and Ernest Mueller.

## DevOps basics

### What is DevOps

DevOps (starting in late 2000s) combines two traditionally siloed IT roles:
- software developers, who write application code
- operations engineers, who set up and manage the systems that applications run on top of (server and network maintenance and stability, security, controlling costs).

> DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers working together through the entire service lifecycle, from the design and development process all the way to production support, including both applications and systems.
>
> DevOps is also characterised by operations engineers using (non-manual, automated) software development techniques and workflows for their systems work.

### DevOps core values: CAMS

The four core values of DevOps are:
- **culture** – We need to change people’s behaviour, break down the ‘wall of confusion’ between developers and operations engineers, so as to improve business outcomes.
- **automation** – We should use software to accelerate change, create and control systems and applications non-manually.
- **measurement** – We should apply holistic metrics to observe and evaluate what is happening with both systems and people.
- **sharing** – We should improve teamwork, transparency and collaboration via documentation, pair programming, peer reviews, mentoring and inclusion.

### DevOps guiding principles: The Three Ways

The Three Ways of DevOps are:
- **systems thinking and the principles of flow** – We should focus on evaluating and improving the outcome of the entire system, rather than focusing on optimising individual parts.
- **amplifing feedback loops** – For example, we should apply frequent unit tests on code to find and fix bugs quickly
- **a culture of continuous experimentation and learning** – We should be open to learning and mastering new skills – Working code wins! If it hurts, do it more often! Fail fast!

### Your DevOps practice playbook

The five practice areas of DevOps are:
- **culture** – We should create and maintain a stable and safe environment, where our **people** can learn, share, experiment, succeed, and even fail.
- **process** – We should incorporate agile and lean product development and management techniques:
  - working in small batches
  - limiting the amount of work in progress
  - incorporating feedback loops
  - lightweight change approval processes.
- **infrastructure as code** – We should use cloud, containers, and otherwise programmable infrastructure, to create an maintain systems using a software development approach.
- **continuous delivery** –
