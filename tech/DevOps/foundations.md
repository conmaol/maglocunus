# DevOps Foundations

My notes from the LinkedIn Learning course *DevOps Foundations*, by James Wickett and Ernest Mueller.

## DevOps basics

### What is DevOps

DevOps (late 2000s) combines two traditionally siloed IT roles:
- developers, who write application code
- operations engineers, who set up and manage the systems that applications run on top of (server and network maintenance and stability, security, controlling costs).

> DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers working together through the entire service lifecycle, from the design and development process all the way to production support, including both applications and systems.
>
> DevOps is also characterised by operations engineers using (non-manual, automated) software development techniques and workflows for their systems work.

### DevOps core values: CAMS

The four core values of DevOps are:
- **culture** – trying to change people’s behaviour, to break down the ‘wall of confusion’ between developers and operations engineers, so as to improve business outcomes
- **automation** – using software to accelerate change, non-manually creating and controlling systems and applications
- **measurement** – applying holistic metrics to observe and evaluate what is happening with both systems and people
- **sharing** – increased teamwork, transparency and collaboration via documentation, pair programming, peer reviews, mentoring and inclusion
