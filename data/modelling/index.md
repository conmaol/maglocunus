# Data Modelling

The DAMA [Data Management Body of Knowledge 2](https://www.dama.org/cpages/body-of-knowledge) (DMBoK) defines data modelling (aka. data design) as follows:

> Data modelling is the process of discovering, analysing, and scoping data **requirements**,  
> and then representing and communicating these data requirements in a precise form called the **data model**.

Why do we do data modelling?
- To understand different **perspectives** on (current and future) business requirements
- To build applications that are better **aligned** to business requirements
- To **support** master data management and data governance
- To lower costs of maintaining/extending existing applications and building new application through increased **reusability**
- To record and preserve **corporate memory**, by capturing knowledge in an explicit form

Here are some notes on individual sections from Chapter 5 (*Data Modeling and Design*) of the DMBoK:
- §1.3. Concepts
  - §1.3.3. [Data model components](DMBoK-data_model_components.md)
  - §1.3.4. [Data modelling schemes](DMBoK-data_modeling_schemes.md)
  - §1.3.5. [Data model levels of detail](DMBoK-data_model_levels.md)
- §2. Activities
- §3. Tools
- §4. Best practices
- §5. Governance
