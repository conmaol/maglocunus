# Data Modelling (and Design)

DMBoK definition:

> Data modeling is the process of discovering, analyzing, and scoping data requirements,  
> and then representing and communicating these data requirements in a precise form called the *data model*.

Goals/aims of data modelling:
- to confirm and document an understanding of different perspectives, leading to application that more closely align with current and future business requirements
- to support master data management and data governance
- to lower costs of maintaining/extending existing systems and building new systems (through increased reusability).

DMBoK sections:
- [Data model components](DMBoK-data_model_components.md)
- [Data modelling schemes](DMBoK-data_modeling_schemes.md)
- [Data model levels of detail](DMBoK-data_model_levels.md)
