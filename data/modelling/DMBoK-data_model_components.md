# Data model components

This document contains my notes from Chapter 5 ยง1.3.3 of the *Data Management Body of Knowledge* 2nd edition (DAMA-DMBoK 2017).

[DMBoK ch 5 ยง 1.3.3]

Most data models contain the same basic building blocks:
- entities
- relationships
- attributes
- domains

## Entity

Definition:

> Entities are things about which an organisation collects information.

eg. people, organisations, products, services, times, dates, locations, events, transactions, documents, quantities.

### Entity aliases

Recommended usage:

> **Entity instance** A (eg. Jane) is an instance of **entity** B (eg. Employee).

Alternative usages:

> Entity A is an instance of entity-type B.
>
> Object A is an instance of class B.

### Graphic representation of entities

Entities are generally depicted as rectangles (perhaps with rounded corners) with their names inside.

### Definition of entities

Entity definitions are core Metadata for any data model, and should exhibit:
- clarity
- accuracy
- completeness

## Relationship

### Relationship aliases

### Graphic representation of relationships

### Relationship cardinality

### Arity of relationships

Unary (recursive) relationship

Binary relationship

Ternary relationaship

### Foreign key

## Attribute

### Graphic representation of attributes

### Identifiers

Construction-type keys

Function-type keys

Identifying vs. non-identifying relationships

## Domain
