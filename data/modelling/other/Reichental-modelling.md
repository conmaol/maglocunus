# Understanding data modelling

\[My notes on the video ‘Understanding data modeling’ from the LinkedIn Learning course *Learning Data Governance* by Jonathan Reichental\]

Data modellers: 
- analyse and define the **business requirements** for data in support of an organisation
- work with business stakeholders to create a **data model**
- **translate** between business users and technical staff

Data models:
- are the foundation for creating the databases that support information systems
- are graphical representations of a specification (ie. **blueprints**)
  - eg. as **entity-relationship diagrams**
- can be:
  - **conceptual** – defining the business concepts and rules required
  - **logical** – specifying how to implement the data solution
  - **physical** – describing in technical detail how the data will be implemented
- can contain:
  - data descriptions
  - constraints
  - rules
  - default values
  - security

Data models are a prerequisite for good data governance, because they:
- elevate data understanding
- ensure **compliance** and regulatory needs are met
- document data uses
- enforce **standards**
- identify missing and problematic data
- instill **discipline** in data management
