# Structured Query Language (SQL)

My notes from Emma Saundersâ€™ LinkedIn Learning course *SQL: Data Reporting and Analysis*.

## `SELECT`

```
SELECT * FROM `actor`
```

```
SELECT first_name FROM actor
```

```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor
```

double quotes = double quotes rather than backticks?

## `WHERE`

<>
!=

## LIKE, IN

## ORDER BY

mm

## String functions

In SELECT statements

length
concat
