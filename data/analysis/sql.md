# Structured Query Language (SQL)

My notes from Emma Saundersâ€™ LinkedIn Learning course *SQL: Data Reporting and Analysis*.

## `SELECT`, `FROM`

```
SELECT * FROM actor
```

```
SELECT first_name FROM actor
```

```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor
```

## `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `BETWEEN`

```
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE first_name = 'PENELOPE'
```

```
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE first_name != 'PENELOPE'

SELECT * FROM actor WHERE first_name <> 'PENELOPE'
```

```
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE actor_id < 5
```

```
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE actor_id >= 5 AND actor_id <= 7

SELECT * FROM actor WHERE actor_id BETWEEN 5 AND 7

```

```
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE actor_id <= 5 OR actor_id >= 7
```
