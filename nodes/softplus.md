# Softplus

The softplus function is a commonly used [activation function](activation_functions.md) in artificial neurons. 

The softplus function is defined as the function $f$ such that:
- $f(x)=\ln(1+e^x)$

The blue solid line in the following diagram represents the softplus function:

As can be seen from this diagram, softplus is essentially a smoothed version of the [ReLU](rectified_linear_unit.md) activation function (the dashed black line).
