# Artificial neurons

An artificial neuron is a very simple computational model of how a biological neuron works.

Mathematically, an artificial neuron can be seen as a function from vectors of real numbers to real numbers.

For example:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(( )) -- "[1.2, -7.3, 0.8]" --> B(neuron) -- "4.6" --> C(( ))
```

An artificial neuron has three internal parameters:
- a vector of weights, one per element in the input vector
- a bias
- an activation function

Letâ€™s take these one at a time.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A(( )) --> B("weights: -3.1, 0.7, 6.0") --> C(( ))
```
