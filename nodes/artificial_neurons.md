# Artificial neurons

An artificial neuron is a function from vectors of real numbers to real numbers, loosely resembling the way a biological neuron works.

The input to an artificial neuron is a vector of real numbers.

And the output from an artificial neron is a real number.

An artificial neuron has three internal parameters:
- a vector of weights, one per element in the input vector
- a bias
- an activation function
