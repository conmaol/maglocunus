# Artificial intelligence - introduction

\[My notes from Chapter 1 of *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig (1995).\]

> AI is the study of *agents* that exist in an environment and perceive and act. [p. 1]

AI attempts to understand, <mark>and strives to build</mark>, intelligent entities – entities (biological or electronic) which can perceive, understand, predict and manipulate a world far larger and more complicated than themselves.

AI was formally initiated as a field of study in 1956, combining:
- 2000 years of philosophical study of intelligence – seeing, learning, remembering, reasoning
- the advent of usable computers in the early 1950s – ‘electronic super-brains’ – to test out the philosophical theories

AI has **subfields** (eg. perception, logical reasoning) and specific **tasks** (eg. playing chess, proving mathematical theorems, writing poetry, diagnosing diseases).

## 1.1. What is AI?

Definitions of AI fall into two general groups:
- understanding and building entities that <mark>think</mark>
  - reasoning, minds, mental faculties, decision-making, problem-solving, learning, computations
- understanding and building entities that <mark>act</mark>
  - intelligent behaviour, performing functions

Orthogonal to this, definitions of AI fall into two further groups:
- understanding and building entities that are <mark>like humans</mark>
- understanding and building entities that are <mark>intelligent</mark>
  - rational – do the right thing

### Acting humanly: the Turing Test approach

The Turing Test (1950) aims to provide an **operational definition of intelligence** (or at least intelligent behaviour):

> the ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks, sufficient to fool an interrogator

This involves the following capabilities:
- <mark>natural language processing</mark> – communicating successfully in English
- <mark>knowledge representation</mark> – storing information provided before or during the interview
- <mark>automated reasoning</mark> – using stored information to answer questions and draw new conclusions
- <mark>machine learning</mark> – adapting to new circumstances, detecting and extrapolating patterns

The **Total Turing Test** adds physical interaction to the mix (using a video signal and a hatch):
- <mark>computer vision</mark> – perceiving objects
- <mark>robotics</mark> – moving objects around

Simple trying to passing the Turing Test (as in mimicking human behaviour to fool users) has not been a huge priority in AI research, apart from when desiging machines that need to interact with humans and hence need to behave according to certain established conventions of human interaction.
