# Artificial intelligence - introduction

\[My notes from Chapter 1 of *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig (1995).\]

> AI is the study of *agents* that exist in an environment and perceive and act. [p. 1]

AI attempts to understand, <mark>and strives to build</mark>, intelligent entities – entities (biological or electronic) which can perceive, understand, predict and manipulate a world far larger and more complicated than themselves.

AI was formally initiated as a field of study in 1956, combining:
- 2000 years of philosophical study of intelligence – seeing, learning, remembering, reasoning
- the advent of usable computers in the early 1950s – ‘electronic super-brains’ – to test out the philosophical theories

AI has **subfields** (eg. perception, logical reasoning) and specific **tasks** (eg. playing chess, proving mathematical theorems, writing poetry, diagnosing diseases).

## 1.1. What is AI?

Definitions of AI fall into two general groups:
- understanding and building entities that <mark>think</mark>
  - reasoning, minds, mental faculties, decision-making, problem-solving, learning, computations
- understanding and building entities that <mark>act</mark>
  - intelligent behaviour, performing functions

Orthogonal to this, definitions of AI fall into two further groups:
- understanding and building entities that are <mark>like humans</mark>
- understanding and building entities that are <mark>intelligent</mark>
  - rational – do the right thing



Acting humanly: the Turing Test approach

Thinking humanly: the cognitive modelling approach

Thinking rationally: the laws of thought approach

Acting rationally: the rational agent approach
