§0.1. A modern neural network is a network of small computing units, each of which takes a vector of input values and produces a single output value. These are typically <mark>feedforward</mark> networks in that the computation proceeds iteratively from one layer of units to the next. 

§0.2. The use of modern neural nets is often called <mark>deep learning</mark>, because modern networks are often deep (have many layers).

§0.3. Neural networks share much of the same mathematics as <mark>logistic regression</mark>. However they are a more powerful classifier than logistic regression – a minimal neural network (technically one with a single ‘hidden layer’) can be shown to learn any function.

§0.4. Unlike with regression classifiers, working with neural networks typically avoids having to develop rich hand-derived features based on domain knowledge for different tasks. We build neural networks that take raw words as inputs and learn to induce features as part of the process of learning to classify. Deep neural nets are the right tool for tasks that offer sufficient data to learn features automatically.
