# Generative AI vs. Traditional AI

\[My notes from LinkedIn Learning course *Generative AI vs. Traditional AI* by Doug Rose (2023)\]

§1. *Generative AI* builds on decades of work in *Predictive AI*.

§2. There is not ‘one big AI’; AI is ‘just a set of tools’ built to solve specific problems.

§3. Predictive AI uses *Machine Learning algorithms* (typically *Artificial Neural Networks*) to get more value from massive amounts of data, by *generalising* over past events/behaviour and hence *predicting* future events/behaviour.

Some other things to learn about:
- self-supervised learning
- foundation models
- Large Language Models
- diffusion models
- auto-encoding
