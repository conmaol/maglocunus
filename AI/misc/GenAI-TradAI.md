# Generative AI vs. Traditional AI

\[My notes from LinkedIn Learning course *Generative AI vs. Traditional AI* by Doug Rose (2023)\]


## Main points

§1. <mark>Generative AI</mark> builds on decades of work in <mark>Predictive AI</mark>.

§2. There is not ‘one big AI’ – AI is ‘just a set of tools’ built to solve specific problems.

§3. Predictive AI uses <mark>Machine Learning</mark> algorithms (typically <mark>Artificial Neural Networks</mark>) to get more value from massive amounts of data, by *generalising* over past events/behaviour and hence *predicting* future events/behaviour.

§4. There are two different kinds of Machine Learning algorithm used in Predictive AI:
- <mark>Supervised learning</mark> algorithms are *trained* to *classify* inputs according to a predetermined classification.
- <mark>Unsupervised learning</mark> algorithms *cluster* inputs and hence create their own classification.

§5. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are Machine Learning algorithms that are inspired by the (low-level) architecture of the human brain.

§6. <mark>Deep learning</mark> ANNs are ANNs with lots of ‘layers’. 

§7. *Google Brain* (2011) is an unsupervised deep learning ANN that found patterns in (ie. clustered) still images from YouTube. This kind of AI led to the development of *Generative AI*, which could use these clusters/patterns to create brand new images.

§8. An ML <mark>model</mark> is an abstraction (generalised knowledge) that maps known data to something new (via training).

§9. A trained model is good for a specific task but is not flexible – this is a problem for Generative AI.



Some other things to learn about:
- self-supervised learning
- foundation models
- Large Language Models
- diffusion models
- auto-encoding

A <mark>classifier</mark> is a computer which decides which of a small set of predefined output classes the input belongs to.
- A <mark>binary classifier</mark> is a classifier with just two output classes (eg. `True` and `False`). 

A <mark>supervised learner</mark> is a computer which builds classifiers. The input is a collection of pre-classified inputs and the output is a (trained) classifier.

A <mark>clusterer</mark> (or unsupervised learner) is a computer which ... The input is a collection of (unclassified) inputs and the output is a ... (classifier?).
