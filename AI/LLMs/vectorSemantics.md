# Vector semantics

ยง1. Given vocabulary $V$ of words:
- a <mark>document</mark> over $V$ is a finite sequence $D = w_1w_2...w_n$ where every $w_i$ in $D$ is in $V$
- a <mark>corpus</mark> over V is a finite set of documents over V.

ยง2. Given vocabulary $V$ and corpus $C$ over $V$, the meaning of document $D$ in $C$, written $[[D]]$, is the function from $V$ to $N$ defined as follows:
- $[[D]](w)$ is the number of times word $w$ occurs in $D$. 

Given vocabulary V and corpus C over V, the macro-level meaning of word w in V is the function f from C to N such that f(D) is the number of times w occurs in document D.

Given vocabulary V and corpus C over V, the micro-level meaning of word w1 in V is the function f from V to N such that f(w2) is the number of times w2 occurs within four words of w1 in (some document in) C. 

Note that if the meaning of w1 is f and f(w2) = n then the meaning of w2 is g where g(w1) = n.
