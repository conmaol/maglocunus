# Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat Explained

\[My notes from Lisa Crosbie’s video *[Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFy0aR5bgZw)*.\]

§1. There are two different versions of MS365 Copilot:
- **MS365 Copilot Chat** – Copilot for All
- **MS365 Copilot** – Your Personal AI Assistant

§2. <mark>MS365 Copilot Chat</mark>:
- is free to use (for enterprise users)
- can be accessed at `m365.copilot.com`
- provides a secure chat experience (see green enterprise data protection flag) –
  - every interaction is commercially protected
  - no data should leak out into training etc
- is grounded in web data
- is based on OpenAI’s GPT-4o
- allows for 16k character prompts
- allows users to attach files to prompts (eg. MSWord docs)
- allows query responses to be opened in MSLoop for real-time collaborative editing (‘Copilot Pages’ feature)
- allows users to create limited (instruction-based) **custom agents** grounded in web data (for free!)
- allows **PAYG** (consumption-based) access for users to build custom agents grounded in their commercial (enterprise) data (their MS Graph?)
- allows enterprise admins to restrict –
  - which users have access to Copilot Chat
  - which users can use particular custom agents
  - which users can create custom agents 

§3. <mark>MS365 Copilot</mark>:
- costs $30 per user per month
- has distinct chat tabs/contexts for ‘work’ and ‘web’, allowing users to switch between knowledge sources
- allows users to access Copilot from within their MS apps (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook etc)
- allows users to build (limited?) custom agents grounded in work and web data sources
- BUT: onus is on users to make sure their Sharepoint sites are well-organised and tagged!
