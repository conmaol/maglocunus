# Microsoft 365 Copilot Gets Smarter - Big Changes Ahead

\[My notes from Lisa Crosbie’s video *[Microsoft 365 Copilot Gets Smarter - Big Changes Ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoPMxaPuCYE)* – 2025-04-28\]

§1. What is coming next from MS365 Copilot in May 2025?
- reasoning models
- memory

## New capabilities in MS365 Copilot

§2. It looks like there will be a <mark>desktop app</mark> experience for Copilot, and not just a webapp.

§3. There will be a redesigned, <mark>cleaner UI</mark> – all important menu/navigation stuff on the LHS.

§4. There will be a clear distinction between the **search** and **chat** tasks/experiences
  - Apparently users have been using Copilot as a very expensive, somewhat clunky search engine!

§5. <mark>Notebooks</mark> (inspired by Google’s NotebookLM) will allow users to create chat-driven notebooks to manage their content on a project level. This will include a **podcast-style audio overview** of your content.

§6. <mark>Create</mark> positions Copilot at the centre of your entire working life, allowing you to create all manner of content from the Copilot app – images, posters, draft documents, spreadsheets, presentations, emails, etc.

§7. <mark>Memory and personalisation</mark> allows Copilot to remember a lot more about its interactions with you, and to learn how you like do do things.

## New agents

§8. Copilot will include new kinds of model:
- reasoning models
- research models – like consulting an experiencd senior colleague rather than an enthusiastic intern.

## New Copilot control systems tools
