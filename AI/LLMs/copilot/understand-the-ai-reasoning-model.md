# Understand the AI reasoning model powering Copilot’s smartest features

\[My notes from Lisa Crosbie’s video *[Understand the AI reasoning model powering Copilot’s smartest features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0bbBDLWlGU)* (2025-05-05)\]

§1. What are **reasoning models** (aka. **research models**) and how do they differ from the older **chat models**?
- chat models are like enthusiastic interns
- reasoning models are like very experienced senior colleagues – figuring out how to solve a problem independently using chain-of-thought reasoning (step by step); essentially having a conversation with itself before reporting back to the user

§2. The best way to prompt a chat model is by giving very **precise instructions**, and engage in iterative conversation. The best way to prompt a reasoning model is to **write a brief** for a research paper, giving it a high-level goal.

§3.
