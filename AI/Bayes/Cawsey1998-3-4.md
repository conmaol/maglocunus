# Reasoning under uncertainty – Cawsey (1998)

\[Notes from §3.4 of *The Essence of Artificial Intelligence* by Alison Cawsey (1998)\]

§1. Given hypothesis $H$ (eg. patient B is having a heart attack) and symptom $S$ (eg. B has shooting pain up his arm):
- $P(H)$ denotes the probability of $H$ in the absence of any known symptoms – the number of people having a heart attack right now divided by the total number of people currently living.
- $P(H|S)$ denotes the (conditional) probability of $H$ given known symptom $S$ – the probability that B is having a heart attack given that we know he is experiencing shooting pain up his arm.

§2. Conditional probability is defined as follows:

$$P(H|S) = {P(H\wedge S) \over P(S)}$$

In concrete terms:

The probability that B is having a heart attack given that we know he is experiencing shooting pain up his arm is: 
- the probability that B is both having a heart attack and experiencing shooting pain up his arm
- divided by
- the probability that B is experiencing shooting pain up his arm.

the number of people who are currently both having a heart attack and experiencing shooting pain up their arm, divided by the number of living people

the number of people who are currently both having a heart attack and experiencing shooting pain up their arm, divided by the number of living people

divided by the number of people currently having a heart attack
