Last week the BBC podcast *Radical with Amol Rajan* published an [interview](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002ht32) with Dario Amadei. This is also available on [BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan).

Rough sections:
- 1.30: Is AI over-hyped?
  - AI development since 2015 has vastly exceeded expectations
  - gold medals at Math Olympiad
  - 90% of production code at Anthropic
  - PhD level scientist
  - biomedical discoveries
  - clinical study reports
- 6.00: ‘Machines of Love and Grace’
  - huge opportunities!
  - find cures for diseases with complex origins (cancer, Alzheimers, ageing ie. not just viruses)
  - AI can absorb and connect new information much much faster than humans – much faster medical diagnosis
  - economic development in Subsaharan Africa
- 13.20: ‘bloodbath’ of entry-level white collar jobs
- 18.30: Are policymakers really aware of this?

Editorial in yesterday’s Guardian: [The Guardian view on Britain’s AI strategy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-britains-ai-strategy-the-risk-is-that-it-is-dependency-dressed-up-in-digital-hype)

Namechecks two ‘AI thought leaders’:
- [Cecilia Rikap](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/94616-cecilia-rikap) (UCL) – recent appearance on Politics Theory Other podcast – “Britain risks becoming a satellite of the US tech industry – a nation whose public infrastructure serves primarily as a testing ground and data source for American AI models hosted on US-owned cloud computing networks”.
- [Daron Acemoglu](https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/daron-acemoglu) (MIT) – “Far from ushering in a golden age of labour augmentation, today’s AI rollout is geared almost entirely toward labour displacement. AI can empower workers – or replace them. Right now, it is doing the latter. Ministerial pledges of productivity gains may just mean fewer jobs – not better services.”
  - [The World Needs a Pro-Human AI Agenda](https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/ai-and-agi-designed-to-replace-workers-worst-of-all-possible-worlds-by-daron-acemoglu-2024-11)
  - [When mistakes involve powerful technologies, you’re going to have trouble](https://www.ft.com/content/67e49261-d046-424e-adf7-7cef5cb00292)
  - [The simple macroeconomics of AI](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2024-05/The%20Simple%20Macroeconomics%20of%20AI.pdf) – “challenged Goldman Sachs’ 10-year forecast that AI would lead to global growth of 7% – about $7tn – and estimated instead under $1tn in gains. Much of this would be captured by US big tech.”

Summary: 
- The UK Government should:
  - build a public cloud
  - fund open-source AI models
  - create institutions capable of steering technological development toward social ends.
- The UK Government should not:
  - buy AI and cloud technology from American big tech companies, thus increasing our dependence on the US.
