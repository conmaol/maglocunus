# Chapter I

## External viewpoint

It is the late 1880s, on the banks of the River Pantai (nowadays the Berau), a short way inland from the coast of Dutch East Borneo. The sun is setting. Kaspar Almayer, a late middle-aged European, is standing on the veranda of his house, both elbows resting on the balustrade, looking out over the great, broad river flowing past. The house is new but already decaying, the heat is close and stifling, the river is swollen by rain, angry and muddy, with big dead logs and whole uprooted trees floating downstream.

A woman’s shrill voice emanates from within: “Kaspar! Makan! (*Let’s eat!*)”. Kaspar shuffles *uneasily*.

Some time later, Kaspar shivers. It is now dark, and there is light from a fire outside the stockade of the Rajah’s compound across the river. He crosses the veranda *cautiously* and descends the ladder *carefully* to the uneven ground below, cluttered with decaying planks and half-sawn beams.

Dain arrives at the river bank in a canoe with two other men. Kaspar and Dain converse briefly. Dane and his men leave again in the canoe, cross the river to the Rajah’s compound, and go inside.

Kaspar enters his house.
