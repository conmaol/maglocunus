## Main narrative

KA is standing on the veranda of his decaying house, watching the sun set over the swollen, angry, muddy river as he daydreams about his splendid future. His wife calls him in to dinner, but he ignores her, watching the dead logs and uprooted trees floating downstream and thinking back to his younger days in Macassar. Suddenly, it is dark and DM appears at the bank in a canoe with two other men. Dain promises to come back the next day and heads off across the river to the Rajah’s stockaded compound. KA goes inside.
