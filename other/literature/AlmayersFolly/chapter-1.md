# Chapter I

## External viewpoint

A late middle-aged European is standing on the veranda of a house at sunset, with  both elbows on the balustrade, looking out over a great, broad river flowing by. The house is new but already decaying, the heat is close and stifling, the river is swollen by rain, angry and muddy, with big dead logs and whole uprooted trees floating downstream.

*The man is Kasper Almayer, it is the late 1880s, and the river is the Pantai (nowadays the Berau) in Dutch East Borneo.*

A woman’s shrill voice emanates from within: “Kaspar! Makan!” *Kaspar! Let’s eat!*

The man shuffles *uneasily*.

Some time later, he shivers.

It is now dark, and a fire has been lit outside the stockade of a compound across the river. *The compound belongs to the Rajah*.

The man steps *cautiously* across the loose planks of the veranda to the ladder. A lizard scurries though the long grass on the riverbank down below. The man descends the ladder *carefully*. The ground is uneven, with stones, decaying planks and half-sawn beams all piled up in confusion.

The man turned towards the house.

There was the sound of paddles splashing from the river.

The man stopped.

The sound of the paddles came closer, accompanied by a whisper and heavy breathing.

The man muttered: “Arabs, no doubt. What are they up to now? Some of Abdulla’s business, curse him!”
