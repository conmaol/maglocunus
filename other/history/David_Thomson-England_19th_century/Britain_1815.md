# Britain in 1815

[Notes from chapter 1 of David Thomson’s (1950) *England in the 19th Century*]

## The social scene

§1. The climax of the Napoleonic Wars at Waterloo in 1815 came during a time of unprecedented social change in Britain –
- The population was growing rapidly, with both immigration from Ireland and emigration to North America.
- Cities were growing rapidly, as was urban poverty (slum-dwelling, gin-drinking, starvation).
- Industrialisation was accelerating – coal mines, textile mills, blast furnaces, new machine-tools (“machines which made machines”), invented by [Joseph Bramah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bramah) and [Henry Maudslay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Maudslay).
- Transportation networks were rapidly expanding – canals, the new main roads built by [Thomas Telford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Telford) and [John McAdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Loudon_McAdam).
- Agriculture was becoming ever more efficient, through enclosure and improvements in drainage, ditching, hedging, tilling, crop rotation, and stock-breeding.
- Land ownership was becoming ever more concentrated in the hands of “a new, more irresponsible and purely profit-making class of landed gentry which had drawn its wealth from trade and finance” – “the ‘Nabobs’ of the East India Company and the stock-holders of the national debt”. There were fewer andfewer small-holders (‘yeoman farmers’) and cottagers, and ever more tenant farmers and agricultural labourers.

§2. The [‘Speenhamland system’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speenhamland_system) involved “paying poor relief to supplement wages”, helping “the labouring and manufacturing classes” to “evade starvation”. This practice “pauperised and demoralised” the working classes in the long run, but “benefited the large employing farmer” – “It relieved him from the need to pay his workmen a living wage, and forced the small independent parish ratepayer to contribute, via the poor rate, to the wages bill of the big farmer and the big manufacturer”. [p. 15–16]

§3. In London, the Regency was “the age of the [dandies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandy) and their feminine counterparts the dandizette, with their exaggeratedly foppish costumes and habits; of Beau Brummell and the popularity of Brighton; of dignified gentlemen flying along the roads on their hobby-horses – a new craze which was a cross between a scooter and a bicycle, propelled by the feet on the ground.” [p. 19]
