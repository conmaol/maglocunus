# Britain in 1815

## The social scene

§1. The [‘Speenhamland system’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speenhamland_system) involved “paying poor relief to supplement wages”, helping “the labouring and manufacturing classes” to “evade starvation”. This practice “pauperised and demoralised” the working classes in the long run, but “benefited the large employing farmer” – “It relieved him from the need to pay his workmen a living wage, and forced the small independent parish ratepayer to contribute, via the poor rate, to the wages bill of the big farmer and the big manufacturer”.

§2. Dandies and dandizettes [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandy]
