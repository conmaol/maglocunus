# Britain in 1815

[Notes from chapter 1 of David Thomson’s (1950) *England in the 19th Century*]

## The social scene

§1. The [‘Speenhamland system’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speenhamland_system) involved “paying poor relief to supplement wages”, helping “the labouring and manufacturing classes” to “evade starvation”. This practice “pauperised and demoralised” the working classes in the long run, but “benefited the large employing farmer” – “It relieved him from the need to pay his workmen a living wage, and forced the small independent parish ratepayer to contribute, via the poor rate, to the wages bill of the big farmer and the big manufacturer”. [p. 15–16]

§2. In London, the Regency was “the age of the [dandies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandy) and their feminine counterparts the dandizette, with their exaggeratedly foppish costumes and habits; of Beau Brummell and the popularity of Brighton; of dignified gentlemen flying along the roads on their hobby-horses – a new craze which was a cross between a scooter and a bicycle, propelled by the feet on the ground.” [p. 19]
