# 大阪 – Osaka 

[Notes from Alex Kerr’s (1993) *Lost Japan* ch. 12]

§1. Like Taro Okamoto’s [太陽の塔](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_the_Sun) (*Taiyō no Tō* – ‘Tower of the Sun’), the centrepiece of [Expo 70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_%2770), 大阪 is ugly but fun.

> Few major cities of the developed world cold match Osaka for the overall unattractiveness of its cityscape, which consists mostly of a jumble of cube-like buildings and a web of expressways and cement-walled canals.
>
> It has the best entertainment districts in Japan, the most lively youth neighbourhood, the most charismatic geisha madams and the most colorful gangsters.

§2. The most characteristic district of 大阪 is [新世界](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsekai) (*Shinsekai* – ‘New World’), built around its own tower – [通天閣](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsūtenkaku) (*Tsūtenkaku* – ‘Tower Reaching Heaven’)

 – dangerous neighbourhood, misbhavious rather than crime – 


Osaka is different to the rest of Japan, but becoming less so.
