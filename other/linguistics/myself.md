# Me, Myself and I

## `I`

`I` can be the subject of a finite verb, except for present tense verbs ending in `-s`:

> `I love Mary.`
>
> `I will love Mary.`
>
> `* I loves Mary.`

`I` cannot be the object of a verb, or the complement of a preposition:

> `* Mary loves I.`
>
> `* Mary will love I.`
>
> `* Mary relies on I.`

`I` can be the final conjunct in a conjoined subject (at least in careful usage):

> `John and I love Mary.`
>
> `* I and John love Mary.`
>
> `* Mary loves John and I.`
>
> `* Mary relies on John and I.`

`I` can be the complement of the comparative words `than` and `as` (in very careful, perhaps archaic, usage):

> `? John is older than I.`
>
> `? John is as old as I.`

## `me`

`me` cannot be the subject of a finite verb:

> `* Me loves Mary.`

`me` can be the object of a verb, or the complement of a preposition, as long as the subject of the (finite) verb is not `I`:

> `Mary loves me.`
>
> `Mary relies on me.`
>
> `* I love me.`
>
> `* I rely on me.`

`me` can be the final conjunct in a conjoined object or complement:

> `Mary loves John and me.`
>
> `Mary relies on John and me.`

But not in a conjoined subject in careful usage:

> `? John and me love Mary.`
>
> `? Me and John love Mary.`

`me` can be the complement of the comparative words `than` and `as`, in normal usage:

> `John is older than me.`
>
> `John is as old as me.`

## `myself`

> `* I like me.`
> 
> `I like myself.`
> 
> `She likes me.`
> 
> `* She likes myself.`
> 
> `* Myself likes me.`
> 
> `* Myself likes myself.`
