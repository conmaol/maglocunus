# Grammatical relations and functional structure

My notes from chapter 2 of Ray S. Jackendoff (1972) *Semantic Interpretation in Generative Grammar*.

## The semantic insufficiency of grammatical relations

There is no straightforward correspondence between traditional grammatical relations and understood semantic relations.

Consider these examples:

> `(2.1) The door opened.`
>
> `(2.2) Charlie opened the door.`

In `(2.1)`:
- The noun phrase `the door` is the grammatical **subject** of the verb `opened`, at both deep and surface structure.
- The material entity denoted by `the door` is the semantic **theme** of the event denoted by `opened`.

In `(2.2)`:
- The noun phrase `the door` is the grammatical **object** of the verb `opened`, at both deep and surface structure.
- But the material entity denoted by `the door` is still the semantic **theme** of the event denoted by `opened`.

Consider the next two examples:

> `(2.3) Fred bought some hashish from Reuben.`
>
> `(2.4) Reuben sold some hashish to Fred.`

In both these sentences the relation between `Fred` and `Reuben` is *recipient-donor*, even though in (2.3) `Fred` is subject and `Reuben` is in a preposition phrase, and the positions are reversed in (2.4).



> `(2.7) The glass dropped to the floor.`
>
> `(2.8) Floyd dropped the glass to the floor.`
>
> `(2.9) Floyd caused the glass to drop to the floor by tickling Sally, who was holding it.`
>
> `(2.10) * Floyd dropped the glass to the floor by tickling Sally, who was holding it.`
