# Grammatical relations and functional structure

My notes from chapter 2 of Ray S. Jackendoff (1972) *Semantic Interpretation in Generative Grammar*.

## The semantic insufficiency of grammatical relations

Grammatical relations: “the structural relations obtaining between verbs and the noun phrases, adjective phrases, prepositional phrases, and sentence complements that they strictly subcategorize”.

“[T]he ‘natural’ grammatical relations such as subject and object do not correspond in any simple fashion to the understood semantic relations.”

Consider these examples:

> `(2.1) The door opened.`
>
> `(2.2) Charlie opened the door.`

In (2.1):
- The noun phrase `the door` is the grammatical **subject** of the verb `opened`.
- The material entity denoted by `the door` is the semantic **theme** of the event denoted by `opened`.

In (2.2):
- The noun phrase `the door` is the grammatical **object** of the verb `opened`.
- But the material entity denoted by `the door` is still the semantic **theme** of the event denoted by `opened`.


The noun phrase `the door` has the same semantic function in both these sentences, even though it is the subject of `opened` in (2.1) and the object in (2.2). Note that, in the traditional generative analysis, no movement transformations are assumed to have taken place in either sentence that would alter the underlying positions.

Consider the next two examples:

> `(2.3) Fred bought some hashish from Reuben.`
>
> `(2.4) Reuben sold some hashish to Fred.`

In both these sentences the relation between `Fred` and `Reuben` is *recipient-donor*, even though in (2.3) `Fred` is subject and `Reuben` is in a preposition phrase, and the positions are reversed in (2.4).



> `(2.7) The glass dropped to the floor.`
>
> `(2.8) Floyd dropped the glass to the floor.`
>
> `(2.9) Floyd caused the glass to drop to the floor by tickling Sally, who was holding it.`
>
> `(2.10) * Floyd dropped the glass to the floor by tickling Sally, who was holding it.`
