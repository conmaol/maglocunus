# Grammatical relations and functional structure

My notes from chapter 2 of Ray S. Jackendoff (1972) *Semantic Interpretation in Generative Grammar*.

## The semantic insufficiency of grammatical relations

There is no straightforward correspondence between traditional grammatical relations and understood semantic relations (a.k.a. ‘functional structure’).

Consider these examples (demonstrating the causative/inchoative alternation):

> `(2.1) The door opened.`
>
> `(2.2) Charlie opened the door.`

In `(2.1)`:
- The noun phrase `the door` is the grammatical **subject** of the verb `opened`.
- The material entity denoted by `the door` is the semantic **theme** of the event denoted by `opened`.

Whereas in `(2.2)`:
- The noun phrase `the door` is now the grammatical **object** of the verb `opened`.
- But the material entity denoted by `the door` is still the semantic **theme** of the event denoted by `opened`.

Consider the next two examples:

> `(2.3) Fred bought some hashish from Reuben.`
>
> `(2.4) Reuben sold some hashish to Fred.`

In `(2.3)`:
- `Fred` is grammatical **subject** and semantic **recipient**.
- `Reuben` is grammatical *from*-**complement** and semantic **donor**.

Whereas in `(2.4)`:
- `Fred` is now grammatical *to*-**complement** and still semantic **recipient**.
- `Reuben` is now grammatical **subject** and still semantic **donor**.

In order to enforce a straightforward correspondence between grammatical relations and semantic relations, some linguists have argued that there must be an underlying level of grammatical structure (‘deep structure’) where:
- `the door` is the deep grammatical object of `opened` in both `(2.1)` and `(2.2)`.
- `Fred` is the deep *to*-**complement** of both `bought` in `(2.3)` and `sold` in `(2.4)`.
- `Reuben` is the deep *from*-**complement** of both `bought` in `(2.3)` and `sold` in `(2.4)`. 

These **deep** grammatical structures/relations are converted into the **surface** grammatical structures/relations via grammatical **transformations**:
- The deep object `the door` is converted into the surface subject in `(2.2)`.
- The deep *to*-complement `Fred` is converted into the surface subject in `(2.3)` but not in `(2.4)`.
- The deep *from*-complement `Reuben` is converted into the surface subject in `(2.4)` but not in `(2.3)`.

The existence of deep structure/relations is a corollary of the (strong) **Katz-Postal Hypothesis**.

Generative semantics (Lakoff 1971)

Case Grammar (Fillmore)

> `(2.7) The glass dropped to the floor.`
>
> `(2.8) Floyd dropped the glass to the floor.`
>
> `(2.9) Floyd caused the glass to drop to the floor by tickling Sally, who was holding it.`
>
> `(2.10) * Floyd dropped the glass to the floor by tickling Sally, who was holding it.`
