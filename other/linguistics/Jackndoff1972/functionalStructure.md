# Grammatical relations and functional structure

My notes from chapter 2 of Ray S. Jackendoff (1972) *Semantic Interpretation in Generative Grammar*.

## The semantic insufficiency of grammatical relations

There is no straightforward correspondence between traditional grammatical relations and understood semantic relations (a.k.a. ‘functional structure’).

### Causative/inchoative alternation

Consider these examples:

> `(2.1) The door opened.`
>
> `(2.2) Charlie opened the door.`

In `(2.1)`:
- The noun phrase `the door` is the grammatical **subject** of the verb `opened`.
- The material entity denoted by `the door` is the semantic **theme** of the event denoted by `opened`.

Whereas in `(2.2)`:
- The noun phrase `the door` is now the grammatical **object** of the verb `opened`.
- But the material entity denoted by `the door` is still the semantic **theme** of the event denoted by `opened`.

Thus, with the verb `open`: 
- The semantic theme can correspond to either the grammatical subject or the grammatical object.

### Verbs of buying and selling

Consider the next two examples:

> `(2.3) Fred bought some hashish from Reuben.`
>
> `(2.4) Reuben sold some hashish to Fred.`

In `(2.3)`:
- `Fred` is the grammatical **subject** and the semantic **recipient** of the verb `bought`.
- `Reuben` is the grammatical *from*-**complement** and the semantic **donor** of the verb `bought`.

Whereas in `(2.4)`:
- `Fred` is now the grammatical *to*-**complement** yet still the semantic **recipient** of the verb `sold`.
- `Reuben` is now the grammatical **subject** yet still the semantic **donor** of the verb `sold`.

Thus, with the verbs `buy` and `sell`:
- The semantic recipient can correspond to either the grammatical subject or the grammatical *to*-complement.
- The semantic donor can correspond to either the grammatical subject or the grammatical *from*-complement.
- The grammatical subject can correspond to either the semantic recipient or the semantic donor. 

### Deep grammatical structure

Some generative grammarians believe that there must be a straightforward correspondence between grammatical relations and semantic relations (‘The Katz-Postal Hypothesis’), and have proposed a level of ‘deep’ grammatical structure, distinct from (but related to) the traditional notion of ‘surface’ grammatical structure.

In terms of the examples above:
- The noun phrase `the door` must have the same deep grammatical relation to the verb `opened` in both `(2.1)` and `(2.2)`.
- `Fred` must have the same deep grammatical relation to the verbs `bought` in `(2.3)` and `sold` in `(2.4)`.
- `Reuben` must have the same deep grammatical relation to the verbs `bought` in `(2.3)` and `sold` in `(2.4)`.

Deep grammatical structures are converted into surface grammatical structures by means of transformation rules:
- The noun phrase `the door` is transformed into the surface grammatical subject in `(2.1)` but into the surface grammatical object in `(2.2)`.
- `Fred` is transformed into the surface grammatical subject in `(2.3)` but into the surface grammatical *to*-complement in `(2.4)`.
- `Reuben` is transformed into the surface grammatical *from*-complement in `(2.3)` but into the surface grammatical subject in `(2.4)`.



Generative semantics (Lakoff 1971)

Case Grammar (Fillmore)

> `(2.7) The glass dropped to the floor.`
>
> `(2.8) Floyd dropped the glass to the floor.`
>
> `(2.9) Floyd caused the glass to drop to the floor by tickling Sally, who was holding it.`
>
> `(2.10) * Floyd dropped the glass to the floor by tickling Sally, who was holding it.`
