# Grammatical relations and functional structure

My notes from chapter 2 of Ray S. Jackendoff (1972) *Semantic Interpretation in Generative Grammar*.

## The semantic insufficiency of grammatical relations

> `(2.1) The door opened.`
>
> `(2.2) Charlie opened the door.`

m

> `(2.3) Fred bought some hashish from Reuben.`
>
> `(2.4) Reuben sold some hashish to Fred.`

m

> `(2.7) The glass dropped to the floor.`
>
> `(2.8) Floyd dropped the glass to the floor.`
>
> `(2.9) Floyd caused the glass to drop to the floor by tickling Sally, who was holding it.`
>
> `(2.10) * Floyd dropped the glass to the floor by tickling Sally, who was holding it.`
