The Six V’s of Big Data –
- volume – Big Data involves a lot of data – terabytes, petabytes, exabytes, etc.
- variety – Big Data involves many different kinds of data – structured, semi-structured, unstructured, binary, etc.
- velocity – Big Data is created/updated very quickly and hence needs to be processed very quickly – streaming, batch-processing, etc.
- veracity – Big Data needs to be as accurate and reliable as possible.
- variability – Big Data needs to be as consistent as possible.
