# Software Architecture Foundations

[Notes from Allen Holun’s LinkedIn learning course *Software Architecture Foundations* (2019)]

§1. Software architects design high-level software systems which:
- solve the customer’s real-world problem
- reflect the business domain
- are reliable, scalable and maintainable
- embody aesthetic principles and judgments (cleanliness, elegance) derived from years of programming experience.

§2. Software architects don’t just plug together pre-built components (‘lego blocks’). They start with the customer’s problem and work down towards the implementation.
