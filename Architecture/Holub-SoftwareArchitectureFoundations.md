# Software Architecture Foundations

[Notes from Allen Holun’s LinkedIn learning course *Software Architecture Foundations* (2019)]

§1. Software architects are **high-level** designers of software systems which:
- solve the customer’s real-world problem
- reflect the business domain
- are reliable, scalable and maintainable
- embody aesthetic principles and judgments (cleanliness, elegance) derived from years of programming experience.

§2. Software architects don’t just plug together pre-built components (‘lego blocks’). They start with the customer’s **problem** and work downwards towards the implementation.

## The software architect

§3. Traditional software architects work in **waterfall** organisations. They see themselves as isolated, powerful, brilliant visionary thinkers, decision-makers and permission-granters, whose job it is to spend months creating **big upfront designs** (perhaps in the form of UML diagrams). They then pass on these designs to ‘code monkey’ minions for implementation. 

§4. Modern software architects work in **agile**, **lean** organisations. They welcome change, working in the Inspect and Adapt Loop – talk to users, build/refine, deploy, review, talk to users, ... All design is **incremental** and **experimental**. In an agile team, everybody is an architect, and nobody asks permission to experiment. Agile architects are **servant-leaders** – teaching, coaching, coordinating. They ensure and assure design coherence across the system (‘big picture’), reviewing the work of all sub-teams and guiding/nudging them to improve.

§5. Agile software architects work day-to-day in non-silo’d, cross-functional teams, helping to collaboratively design an architecture which solves a customer’s problem. They use whiteboards, sticky notes and **dot-voting**; they focus on **bounded contexts** and **user stories**; they run **event storming** sessions and conduct **sprint reviews** (live feedback sessions with customers); they do 1-to-1 **mentoring** sessions with team members who want to learn about about software architecture; they run regular **architecture guild** meetings, where one member from each team discuss and improve the architecture.

§6. To be a good software architect, you need to: become a good programmer; know about design patterns and how they interact; network constantly.
